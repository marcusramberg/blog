title: Burning the candle at both ends part II
---

<p>
  In addition to recent fatherhood and doing my own startup and taking over the
  leadership of the Oslo Perl Mongers, I've started a project to get a hacker
  space set up in Oslo. Actually, this ties in to my Oslo Perl Mongers interests
  as well, so it's not a completely new project. I got very inspired by
  <a href="http://twitter.com/kyrah">@kyrah</a>'s talk about
  <a href="http://metalab.at">metalab.at</a> in Wien at
  <a href="http://fscons.org">FSCons</a> in Gothenburg a couple of weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
  I'd like to see something like this in Oslo, so I've set up a Wiki and started
  talking to various other interested parties. If this is something you would be
  interested in happening, please sign up at the
  <a href="http://hackerspaces.means.no">Wiki</a> and the
  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/oslo-hackerspace?lnk=srg"
    >Google Group</a
  >
  and join the discussion.
