<p>Here's another one of the talks from Nordic Perl Workshop 2006 that we're uploading as a promotion of Nordic Perl Workshop 2009. The conference is being held in Oslo again this year, April 16-17. I personally loved this talk by Michael Schwern, and it's not one that gets dated easily, so enjoy.</p>
