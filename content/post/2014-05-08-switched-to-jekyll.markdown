title: Switched to Jekyll
---

This blog has been dead for a while, and as I pondered why, I realized one thing:

_I hate having to log in and write content in the wordpress web app._

To remedy that, I've switched from Wordpress to Jekyll. Writing markdown straight into vim seems much more likely to
happen than posting in the Wordpress web editor. In case you are wondering, the theme I'm using here is
[lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com).

I'm hosting the thing on github.com with CloudFlare in front, because it was really really easy.

Now let's cross our fingers and hope this isn't the most recent post here next year :-)
