title: must-read essay from Doctorow
---
<blockquote>I think we should permanently cut off the internet access of any company that sends out three erroneous copyright notices. Three strikes and you're out, mate.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://craphound.com/">Cory Doctorow</a> is one of those people who brings out my inner fan boy. I could not agree more with his writing if I tried. If you haven't, I recommend checking out his books as well, they are freely available on the internet, or you can buy them at Amazon if you prefer hard copies. There are even audio books.
