title: Introducing ... Me
---

<p>
  Hey there, the internet is a turbulent place, and since I&#8217;ve moved
  around quite a few times, I think I forgot to introduce myself the last time I
  made the move. I am Marcus Ramberg, the writer of this blog, and director of
  Nordaaker, a small British/Norwegian company currently run out of Oslo,
  Norway. In addition to being my personal blog, at the time being this blog
  acts as Nordaaker&#8217;s dynamic english presence. As the other director of
  Nordaaker, Arne Fismen runs our
  <a href="http://arne.nordaaker.com/">norwegian presence</a>.
</p>
<p>
  In one form or another, I&#8217;ve been writing on the internet since around
  2002, when I set up my first own domain,
  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021106102053/http://thefeed.no/"
    >thefeed.no</a
  >. Back then I was running my own
  <a href="http://www.movabletype.com/">MovableType</a> installation. Thanks to
  the glorious <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/">Internet Archive</a> you
  can see my
  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030207101435/thefeed.no/marcus/"
    >first blog</a
  >
  the way it looked about a year after it&#8217;s launch. It is very strange for
  me to go back and read the thoughts I had so many years ago.
</p>
<p>
  I was also hosting other blogs on my MovableType installation, including
  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030604224909/thefeed.no/slemmen/"
    >slemmen</a
  >, who wrote about sysadmin stuff and some college friends like
  <a
    href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030514183347/thefeed.no/marlboro/archives/2002_12.html"
    >marlboro</a
  >
  and
  <a
    href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030810191404/thefeed.no/gry/archives/000308.html"
    >gry</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  On the
  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030529184838/thefeed.no/">front page</a>
  we had a perl script that aggregated all the blogs, a simple planet if you
  will.
</p>
<p>
  Back then, I wrote a lot less about tech than I do now. Looking at the
  categories, we see that the three biggest ones are Travel[44], Geek[36] and
  Opinion[26]. Still, even then I was posting things from the
  <a
    href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030512092014/thefeed.no/marcus/archives/cat_perl.html"
    >Perl Community</a
  >. However, checking back around 2005, a few years later, Geek[108] was
  dominant, With Opinion[49] and Mac[34] as the next ones. Perl is trailing 4.
  with 27 posts. I also wrote
  <a
    href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041209060055/http://thefeed.no/marcus/archives/cat_books.html"
    >18 book reviews</a
  >
</p>
<p>
  About that time I gave my first
  <a
    href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041212151353/thefeed.no/marcus/archives/cat_perl.html"
    >talk about a MVC framework</a
  >.I was already active in the community, contributing a Mason view to Maypole,
  my third CPAN module. I had been using Mason at work for a couple of years by
  then. It was not until I started working for ABC Startsiden that I started
  using Template Toolkit.
</p>
<p>
  About then, disaster struck. My server HDD died, losing a lot of images from
  our image galleries. After that, I lost a lot of the motivation for running
  thefeed, given the risks. Losing people&#8217;s personal data isn&#8217;t fun.
  At least I am glad that the blogs are preserved in the internet archive.
</p>
<p>
  It took a while for me to start writing again after that, but in the period
  2006-2009 I decided to use hosted solutions, keeping both a
  <a href="http://thefeed.vox.com/">vox blog</a> and a
  <a href="http://marcusramberg.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a>, before
  finally moving to this blog installation. I&#8217;m self-hosted again, and the
  software might vary, but I hope the addresses will last for a long time :)
