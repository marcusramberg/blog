title: Introducing ... Me
---
<p>Hey there, the internet is a turbulent place, and since I&#8217;ve moved around quite<br />
a few times, I think I forgot to introduce myself the last time I made the<br />
move. I am Marcus Ramberg, the writer of this blog, and director of<br />
Nordaaker, a small British/Norwegian company currently run out of Oslo,<br />
Norway. In addition to being my personal blog, at the time being this blog<br />
acts as Nordaaker&#8217;s dynamic english presence. As the other director of<br />
Nordaaker, Arne Fismen runs our <a href="http://arne.nordaaker.com/">norwegian presence</a>.</p>
<p>In one form or another, I&#8217;ve been writing on the internet since around<br />
2002, when I set up my first own domain, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021106102053/http://thefeed.no/">thefeed.no</a>.<br />
Back then I was running my own <a href="http://www.movabletype.com/">Movabletype</a> installation.<br />
Thanks to the glorious <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/">Internet Archive</a> you can see my<br />
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030207101435/thefeed.no/marcus/">first blog</a> the way it looked about a year after it&#8217;s launch. It is<br />
very strange for me to go back and read the thoughts I had so many years<br />
ago.</p>
<p>I was also hosting other blogs on my movabletype installation, including<br />
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030604224909/thefeed.no/slemmen/">slemmen</a>, who wrote about sysadmin stuff and some college friends like<br />
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030514183347/thefeed.no/marlboro/archives/2002_12.html">marlboro</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030810191404/thefeed.no/gry/archives/000308.html">gry</a>.</p>
<p>On the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030529184838/thefeed.no/">front page</a> we had a perl script that aggregated all the blogs,<br />
a simple planet if you will. </p>
<p>Back then, I wrote a lot less about tech than I do now. Looking at the<br />
categories, we see that the three biggest ones are Travel[44], Geek[36]<br />
and Opinion[26]. Still, even then I was  journaling things from the<br />
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030512092014/thefeed.no/marcus/archives/cat_perl.html">Perl Community</a>. However, checking back around 2005, a few years<br />
later, Geek[108] was dominant, With Opinion[49] and Mac[34] as the next<br />
ones. Perl is trailing 4. with 27 posts. I also wrote <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041209060055/http://thefeed.no/marcus/archives/cat_books.html">18 book reviews</a></p>
<p>About that time I gave my first <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041212151353/thefeed.no/marcus/archives/cat_perl.html">talk about a MVC framework</a>.I was<br />
already active in the community, contributing a Mason view to Maypole,<br />
my third CPAN module. I had been using Mason at work for a couple of years<br />
by then. It was not until I started working for ABC Startsiden that I started<br />
using Template Toolkit.</p>
<p>About then, disaster struck. My server HDD died, losing a lot of images<br />
from our image galleries. After that, I lost a lot of the motivation for<br />
running thefeed, given the risks. Losing people&#8217;s personal data isn&#8217;t fun.<br />
At least I am glad that the blogs are preserved in  the internet archive.</p>
<p>It took a while for me to start writing again after that, but in the period 2006-2009<br />
I decided to use hosted solutions, keeping both a <a href="http://thefeed.vox.com/">vox blog</a> and a<br />
<a href="http://marcusramberg.livejournal.com/">livejournal</a>, before finally moving to this blog installation.<br />
I&#8217;m self-hosted again, and the software might vary, but I hope the addresses<br />
will last for a long time :)</p>
