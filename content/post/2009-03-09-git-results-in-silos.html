title: Git results in silos?

    That model works well for Linux. Maybe. I'll presume it does. Git eases the
    pain points expressed by Andrew Morton, the maintainer of the -mm tree, in
    this message entitled "This Just Isn't Working Any More"
  </p>
  <p>In short, it makes siloing easier.</p>

  My immediate reaction to reading his post was to think of the old saying
  ‹‹Guns don't kill people, people kill people››. In fact, my experiences with
  forks so far has been two cases of forking repos on github, and doing a pull
  request to the author when my fixes were fit to be included in the main
  distribution. In both cases the authors included my changes in their versions.
</p>
<p>
  Just because there exists a lot of works-in-progress doesn't mean that they
  represent different authoritative versions of a given module. The situation
  for the rails OAuth plugin might be a bit muddled, but thanks to github's
  excellent <a href="http://github.com/pelle/oauth/network">network map</a>,
  it's easy to track all of the 12 forks on github (substantiality less than
  27), out of which most seems to have merged into a new mainline.

  It is clear that this project suffers from a inactive maintainer, but I
  believe that Git forks has lowered the barrier to contributing substantially,
  thus ensuring vitality for open source software projects. Our own Catalyst
  OAuth support, which resides in SVN is still non-working, despite several
  promises from people to look into it. These people might have working support
  in their local applications, but if that is the case, I'm unable to get to
  them or merge it into the started efforts in Catalyst SVN.
</p>
<p>
  To summarize, Git lowers the barrier to contribution. Building or avoiding
  silos is up to the software maintainers, and giving support for patched
  versions is madness any way we look at it. Just the same way as developers are
  on their own when they use development versions of software, they can't expect
  support for forked versions of that software either. If you live on the
  bleeding edge, you are going to bleed a little.
