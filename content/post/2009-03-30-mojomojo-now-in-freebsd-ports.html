title: MojoMojo now in FreeBSD ports.
---
<p>After <a href="http://www.mojomojo.org/">MojoMojo</a>, the CMSish Wiki software that powers <a href="http://dev.catalyst.perl.org">dev.catalyst.perl.org</a> was featured prominently in the <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=42312&cid=67298">CPANTS Heavy 100</a>, there was some concern about how much time was required to install it. However, thanks to the illustrious dane Lars Balker Rasmussen, FreeBSD guys now have it easy. He's fought through our entire dependency list, and uploaded <a href="http://www.freshports.org/www/p5-MojoMojo/">p5-MojoMojo</a> to the FreeBSD ports tree. Hopefully Debian packages won't be far behind. </p>
<p>(In the interest of full disclosure, I am the founder of the MojoMojo project. To contact us, you can use <a href="http://lists.scsys.co.uk/mailman/listinfo/">our mailing list</a>, or come by the <a href="irc://irc.perl.org/#mojomojo">IRC channe</a>)</p>
