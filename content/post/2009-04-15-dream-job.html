<p>Apparently <a href="http://catalystframework.org/">Catalyst</a> and DBIx::Class powers one of the biggest porn sites in the world, <a href="http://youporn.com/">YouPorn</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We operate one of the most visited Catalyst/DBIx::Class sites in the world with 90 million users and hundreds of millions of pageviews per day. </p></blockquote>
<p>They are looking for contractors all over the world. No matter what you might think of the content, the stack they are using seems cool, pretty much the same libraries we use to power <a href="http://iusethis.com/">iusethis</a> and our other sites.</p>
