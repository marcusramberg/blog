title: Diggbar is sleazy
---
<p>So, there has been a lot of noise about the diggbar lately. I think Ted Dziuba of Uncov fame says it best:</p>
<blockquote><p>This move shows that not only is Digg willing to pull some sleazy shit to increase their unique visitors, but that they also need to pull this sleazy shit, because they need more unique visitors.</p></blockquote>
