title: Big oops for Spotify?
---
<p>I just received a  mail from Spotify about a security issue:</p>
<blockquote><p>Along with passwords, registration information such as your email<br />
address,birth date, gender, postal code and billing receipt<br />
details were potentially exposed. Credit card numbers are not<br />
stored by us and were not at risk. All payment data is handled<br />
by a secure 3rd party provider.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh well. At least they hashed our passwords and secured the credit card transactions. All in all, I think they've handled themselves very well. Kudos for being so up front about this as well.</p>
