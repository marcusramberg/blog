title: Why PHP support in MS Azure is FAIL

<p>I do not hate PHP. Ted Dziuba describes my feelings about it perfectly:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes, let me introduce you to the professional PHP programmer. You see, PHP is like a handgun. On its own, it is simply an inanimate tool that has no moral leaning. In the hands of a responsible citizen, it can be used to the benefit of society. But in the hands of someone who is untrained or mentally unstable, it can be used to commit horrible atrocities.</p></blockquote>
