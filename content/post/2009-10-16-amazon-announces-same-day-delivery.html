<p>Whoever decides to provide this service in Oslo for a reasonable price will have me as a loyal customer. Amazon is charging 15$ for normal customers and 6$ for prime customers. Would make a prime membership worth it quite quickly if you live in one of those target cities I guess. (via <a href="http://daringfireball.net"/>daring fireball).</p>
