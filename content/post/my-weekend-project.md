title: My weekend project
---

Really wanted a nice outdoor sofa for our terrace, and this one looks great. So far I've managed to cut and sand all
the wood and make the first frame. Hoping to complete it next weekend.

Note, I did find a bug in these drawings.  Arms need to be 29.5", not 28.5" as 28.5-2-2 is 24.5 not 25.5 :-/
