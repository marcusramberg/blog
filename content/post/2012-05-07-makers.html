title: Makers

    >You can start making something in seconds.<br />
    One simple idea is all you need before your brain<br />
    automatically explores problems, solutions, and dreams.<br />
    Turning that idea into something tangible and wonderful is harder.<br />
    You need structure, strategies, people, hard work.</strong

  The software world is young and we are still figuring out the most basic
  processes of the craft. For instance, we tend to label ourself architects or
  designers, inspired by people who build houses or work in mass production.
</p>
<p>
  Designers tend to paint pictures, while engineers tend to make diagrams
  describing what they want to make. Both of these approaches are fundamentally
  flawed in software. They make a lot of sense in the trades that inspired them,
  where the cost of change is high and getting it right the first time is
  essential. Making software is pretty much the opposite.
</p>
<p>
  With software it's so easy to reiterate that there's no need to choose between
  ideas on the drawing board. You can simply build it and see for yourself how
  it would work. As long as you always make the
  <strong>simplest possible version</strong>, you can quickly verify if it's a
  good idea or not, and it can be rather efficient too.
</p>
<p>
  I'm not saying that you shouldn't use PhotoShop or OmniGraffle in the process
  of making. They are useful tools for making your software better. Refining it,
  making sure they play well with others. However, I believe that a lot of
  the<br />
  'design processes' that go on now are flawed.
</p>
<p>
  In fact, I would like to remove all labels. Take a big magic marker, cross out
  'engineer' or 'designer', and write one word on all of them:
</p>
<p><strong>MAKER</strong></p>
<p>
  I sometimes hear people say 'everything is design'. I do agree that everyone
  who is involved in making software needs to care about what it does, how it
  works, how it feels, and so on. The problem in my mind is that this
  definition<br />
  makes 'design' too generic.
</p>
<p>
  It also tends to exclude programmers and gives the impression that they don't
  need to care about the look and behavior of the end result. In my experience,
  this pattern leads to massive amounts of suck.
</p>
<p>
  Stop thinking about programmers and designers. We're all makers, so don't feel
  limited by such a poorly placed label. You're job is to
  <strong>make</strong> the software. I don't care what hats you wear as long as
  you're contributing. We should always strive to learn more skills, to become
  better makers.
</p>
<p>
  People with a classic IT background should learn more about writing, colors
  and traditional design principles. Those who possess these skills should learn
  more about markup, CSS, Interface Builder, or maintaining resources in version
  control systems and project files. The more you know about how software is
  made, the better you can help making it great.
</p>
<p>
  This does not mean that I advocate design by committee. I do believe all
  software needs a director; one who maintains the vision of what we are making,
  and who instructs and directs the rest of the team. This person is
  ultimately<br />
  responsible for the shape of the product. But without good makers, that person
  is doomed to fail.
</p>
<p><strong>Let us all become better makers.</strong></p>
