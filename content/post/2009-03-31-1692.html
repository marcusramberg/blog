title: Better documentation for complex classes

<blockquote><p>Having been annoyed enough by this sort of POD wrangling already, theorbtwo came up with Pod::Inherit to help the module writers improve their documentation. Run it with the name of a class or the lib directory for your distribution, every class is investigated to determine which methods it contains, the inheritance tree is then searched to determine which base class actually defines that method. </p></blockquote>
<p>I think this is pretty awesome. Thanks to multiple inheritance, mixins, and most recently Moose roles, finding out what methods a given Class provides can sometimes be quite tricky. Pod::Inherit seems to solve that problem nicely. Hopefully it will get widely adopted.</p>
