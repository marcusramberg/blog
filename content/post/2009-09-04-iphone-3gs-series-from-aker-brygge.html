Went for a quick bike ride near Aker Brygge this morning and tested the iPhone 3GS camera. I'd like a tripod mount so I can film from the bike with it. Will test out with the gorillapod and my flip mino hd.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> The first set I published was post-processed using adobe lightroom to give them a mood I like. For reference, I've uploaded the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marcusramberg//sets/72157622114167497">non-postprocessed versions </a>as well</p>
