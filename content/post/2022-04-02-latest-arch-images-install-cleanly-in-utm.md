As part of a recent job change, I also acquired a M1 MBP, which honestly is the best one I've had in the last 20 years. However I'm also a big fan of Linux and tiling window managers, so I was looking to have an Arch wm on the machine and be able to use i3 and get the best of both worlds.

Initially when I tried aarch64 didn't install cleanly from an ISO, and the arch image UTM provides in their gallery is problematic. (Text only, and also depends on external boot files so it starts breaking down once you sync it to latest arch).

However, this latest march image installed cleanly for me with no issues as all, so I'm now the happy user of a working graphical arch image. And running on arm arch it's really snappy on this machine as well. Worth checking out. :)
