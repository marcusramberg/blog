title: Perl 7 Announced
---

Not going to lie, This Perl 7 announcement is the best news I've heard in a while. My biggest outstanding question is
if the are going to be enabling signatures in this release. I really hope so.

Regardless, you can be sure that the Mojo team is 100% behind pushing Perl forward, and I hope to see some exciting
major Perl releases in the years to come.
[Cor](http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2019/10/cor---a-proposal-for-core-perl-oo.html) and async/await in the core are
high on my personal list.
