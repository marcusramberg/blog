title: Github adds inline commit notes.
---
<p>Github is probably much of the reason we love using git at Nordaaker. The great overview and administration system, as well as the simple no-nonsense issue tracker works very efficiently for us. Now github has added another feature that I think will help us collaborating efficiently on code.</p>
<p>Inline commit notes lets you comment anywhere in a commit, lending itself to quick code reviews and clarifications.</p>
