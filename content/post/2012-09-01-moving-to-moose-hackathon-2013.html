title: Moving to Moose Hackathon 2012
---

<p>
  This week, my excellent Perl Mongers group Oslo.pm, led by the excellent
  <a href="http://twitter.com/sjoshuan">Salve</a>,  has arranged an event we
  called the Moving to Moose Hackathon 2012. The purpose of this event was to
  promote the adoption of a MOP (Meta Object Protocol) in Perl development. To
  this effect, we had two groups, the Perl RDF community, looking to adopt moose
  in their modules, and
  <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~stevan/">Stevan Little</a> and his merry gang
  of p5-mop developers, looking to create a proposal for a MOP in the Perl core
  itself, to replace the venerable blessed hash object model.

  Unfortunately due to the arrival of baby Milla in June, I was unable to attend
  the entire event, which started on saturday. Thus I missed the walk to Pulpit
  Rock (did I mention the event was smack in the middle of the Norwegian
  fjords?) Luckily I've been there before (see pic on the right :-). I arrived
  early Tuesday morning by the night train. On the way there, I re-read the
  proposal for the <a href="https://github.com/stevan/p5-mop">p5-mop</a>.

  Since I'm not a mad hatter scientist like
  <a href="http://blog.woobling.org/">Yuval</a> and
  <a href="http://twitter.com/doyster">Jesse</a>, and don't know the Moose MOP
  that well, I concentrated my efforts on tooling and real world triage of the
  prototype. For me, the most exciting idea of the proposal is adding first
  class 'method', 'has' and 'class' keywords, so that you can declare Perl
  classes like this:
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>    class Cat (extends =&gt; Animals) {</div>
<div>      has $claws;</div>
<div>      method meow { ... }</div>
<div>    }</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
  Since I'm an avid TextMate fan (specially since the Open Source release this
  fall), I started by extending the TM2 syntax to support these new keywords.
  This means getting proper highlighting, as well as easy navigation in classes
  and methods. You can find my fork of the official Perl syntax highlighter
  <a href="https://github.com/marcusramberg/perl.tmbundle/tree/p5-mop">here</a>.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
  I then started work on porting a few Mojo base classes to the new syntax.
  Being one of the <a href="http://mojolicio.us/">Mojolicious</a> core
  developers, I know these classes rather well, and they have the advantage of
  being light on dependencies and optimized for easy porting to Perl6, as well
  as having comprehensive test suites. This made them an ideal target for trying
  out features of the prototype. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
  Of course I met some hardship underway. The biggest issue for me during the
  port was the lack of BUILDARGS, a class method to massage the constructor
  parameters into a hash, but all in all the experience was quite educational. I
  also found some small points of improvement in the specifications during my
  attempts, and submitted a simple doc patch. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
  Together with Jan Henning, I also looked into the feasibility of supporting
  overloading in the new p5-mop classes, and Jan Henning ended up writing a
  <a href="https://github.com/jhthorsen/p5-mop/tree/mopx-overload"
    >new meta class</a
  > to support this. I believe this should be refactored into a meta role when
  the mop has been updated with support for that.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
  In the period that I was there, the main p5-mop developers struggled quite a
  bit with an issue in the dispatching that was giving bizarre errors and was
  really hard to track down. Unfortunately, this slowed down development, as we
  were unable to start using the new two-phase bootstrap code which  would allow
  us much easier development of the meta classes. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
  However, I was really excited about the discussions about the new 'meta'
  keyword on the last night of the hackathon to allow meta definitions (and thus
  class methods, and roles) in the class definitions themselves.  I quite look
  forward to the updated prototype, and hope to resume my port as soon as
  BUILDARGS support has landed.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
  I think the crucial question now is if we can manage to maintain velocity in
  the development of the p5-mop prototype after this hackathon. I truly hope we
  can start seeing real world usage of it soon. This is the best way to figure
  out gotchas and problems with the specification before it lands in the core.
