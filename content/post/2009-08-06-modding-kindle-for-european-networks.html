title: Modding kindle for european networks
---
<p>So some European madman got himself a Kindle on the 30. July, and the first thing he did with it is pop it open and replace the US-centric mobile card:</p>
<blockquote><p>I modded the<br />
Kindle 2 with a<br />
3G HSPA modem and a<br />
Simcard holder for use in<br />
Europe.</p></blockquote>
<p>Apparently It's not tested at all yet, so I'm very interested to see how this turns out. He will probably need some software support to get it working. Somehow I still think he needs to work around the GPS Amazon use to track the location of your device.</p>
