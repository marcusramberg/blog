title: Accessing your Catalyst config from scripts
---
<p>Often, I need to write command line scripts that access my apps' data models. With Catalyst, one way to do this is to to load the actual application, like</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>use iusethis;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I can access my models like iusethis-&gt;model('DBIC::Person') . However, all I really need is to get the application configuration, and loading a big application is a lot of overhead. Just using Config::Any isn't a good solution tho, since it does not handle _local files properly, among other thing. However, with Config::JFDI there's a better way.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>use Config::JFDI;
my $jfdi = Config::JFDI-&gt;new(name =&gt; "iusethis");
my $config = $jfdi-&gt;get;
my $schema = iusethis::Schema-&gt;connect( @{$config-&gt;{'Model::DBIC'}-&gt;{'connect_info'}})
    or die "Failed to connect to database";</pre>
</blockquote>
