title: Even Enterprise thinks enterprise sucks
---

<p>
  Early in my career I worked for a large telco at. The term "Enterprise
  Software" still gives me me chills down the spine. Likewise terms like WS-*
  and SOA, which for me represents huge amounts of bloat and hatefulness.
</p>
<p>
  This is in fact one of the reasons I prefer working in smaller more agile
  shops. Apparently, I'm not alone in disliking enterprise software. Software
  AG's "Chief Strategist" Miko Matsumura sums it up well:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Working with Enterprise Software feels a bit like walking through an
    industrial landfill or an airport hangar. Nothing is built to human scale.
