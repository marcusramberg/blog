title: Fixing the POD synopsis in OSX

<p>
  Having problems copying example code from POD and getting invalid characters
  in your Perl? Apparently this is a problem with nroff on OS X (According to my
  linux hacking peeps), but the solution is quite simple. Just stuff this in
  your .profile or whatever ;)
</p>
<p><code>alias perldoc='perldoc -t'</code></p>
<p>
  And your pod is rendered in glorious pure-text, without using weird characters
  for ' and -.
</p>
