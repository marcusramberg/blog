title: Perl community not generating any internal buzz?
---
<p><a href="http://use.perl.org/~chromatic/journal/">Chromatic</a> points to a trend in the Perl community of not giving any link love to our own. Somehow, it feels like I've <a href="http://hanekomu.at/blog/2008/09/20#20080920-1033-putting_your_money_where_your_mouth_is">heard this before</a>. I agree this is a negative trend, but I find it amusing that it comes from chromatic, the only posters I can remember him linking to in his journal is people spreading FUD about Perl, in is mission to refute their statements. Somehow it seems to me like linking to these people and giving them attention is only making them stronger...</p>
