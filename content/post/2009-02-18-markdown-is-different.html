title: Markdown is different
---
<p><em>David Wheeler says</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Lately I’ve been fiddling a bit with Markdown, John Gruber’s minimalist plain text markup syntax. I’ve become more and more attracted to Markdown after I’ve had to spend some time using Trac and, to a lesser degree, Twiki and MediaWiki. The plain-text markup syntax in these projects is…how shall I put this?… gawdawful</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a big part of the reason why we chose <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> along with <a href="http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/">Textile</a> as the supported Wiki markup languages for <a href="http://mojomojo.org/">MojoMojo</a>. Having edited some wikipedia-pages, as well as Trac , while we were using that for the <a href="http://dev.catalyst.perl.org/">catalyst dev wiki</a>, I totally agree. Their markup language makes me want to hurl. </p>
