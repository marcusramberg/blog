title: Reasons to not use CouchDB
---

<p>
  It's quite interesting to read nothingmuch' reasons for not using CouchDB. In
  particular this is a bit of a wake-up call for me:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    This means that you have to live with the same limitations of SQL queries
    (the fact that they are non recursive, so they can't express transitive
    relationships), but you don't get the freedom to write queries ad hoc and
    have them execute efficiently (ad hoc views are supported, but there are no
    general purposes indexes).
  </p>

  I really need to find some time to try out
