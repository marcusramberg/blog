title: Latest OSX Security upgrade can break your Perl
---
<p>Apple has shipped a somewhat untested security update, it seems. After installing it, my Catalyst apps stopped working in development. Trying to reinstall some modules through the CPAN shell brought further misery. Luckily, <a href="http://bulknews.typepad.com/blog/">Miyagawa</a> had already <a href="http://bulknews.typepad.com/blog/2009/02/mac-os-x-security-update-2009001-breaks-perl-cpan.html">posted a solution</a> to the CPAN problem. </p>
<p>In addition, it seems they have installed a broken Scalar::Utils, so after following his advice and installing IO manually to get a unbroken CPAN shell, I suggest running</p>
<pre>cpan> force install Scalar::Util</pre>
<p>To get a working weaken again.  At least this fixes my stuff, but they might have broken more XS stuff. I'll keep you posted if I discover anything else.</p>
