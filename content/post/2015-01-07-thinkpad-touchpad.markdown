title: Fixing the Thinkpad Buttonless Touchpad
---

> The default configuration of the xf86-input-synaptics driver makes the clickpad almost unusable (on the T440s).
> Clicks/Taps do not register properly, misclicking, no palm detection, no soft buttons where they should be, and so
> on...
> The following configuration can be put in `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-synaptics.conf` As a result the clickpad will react
> a lot more 'calm' than before and the middle & right click button areas match with the printed ones on top of the
> clickpad.

New laptop, new woes
