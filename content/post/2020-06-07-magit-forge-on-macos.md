I've tried many editor git integrations over the years, in Vim, VS Code, IntelliJ, Sublime, as well as various git guis. However I've never found something nearly as powerful and efficient day to day as working on the command line.

While I will probably never give up the command line, with Emacs' Magit I've finally found a valuable companion which feels as powerful and efficient as the cli interface. The magit status window is a fantastic.
