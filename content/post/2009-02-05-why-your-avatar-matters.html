title: Why your avatar matters
---
<p>Good article about Avatars. As we continue to build our internet personalities, branding gets more and more important. Wonder if I should add an avatar to the sidebar of this blog?</p>
<p>I tend to switch between a <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~mramberg/">Self portrait</a> I took while Photographing <a href="http://www.startsiden.no/om">ABC Startsiden</a> and my <a href="http://twitter.com/marcusramberg">Manga me</a> (From <a href="http://faceyourmanga.com/">Face your manga</a>). I feel that both of them work, as the manga one is quite recognizable),  but I would love to get a good hand-drawn one, as I feel the manga ones are a bit generic.</p>
