title: Tactical overview of your varnish instances
---
<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/varnish-top/">varnish-top</a> is a handy util for keeping track of our varnish installation (via <a href="http://del.icio.us/denisb">Denis</a>). From the google-code project page page:</p>
<blockquote><p>Simply, it is a tool that lets you monitor a few key stats from one or more varnish boxes in real-time, from the command line, in a top-like screen. It's not the most sophisticated tool, but is handy for seeing a real-time view into how your box(es) are doing without needing to set up graphing, open up a browser, etc.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here's a slightly altered snapshot from iusethis:</p>
