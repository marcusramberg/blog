title: beorg - org mode on the go
---

One of the big reasons I finally succumbed to the [Evil](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil) side was the search for a
comprehensive notes and todo system.

I've been testing many approaches, like [Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/) and
[Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/), but [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) is by far the best I've found so far.

In 2020 mobile is a critical component for such a system, and thus beorg was an important part of that decision. It's
an impressive piece of software, implementing all the important features of org mode like syncing, all aspects of
sheduling and repeats , custom todo states and a comprehensive parser.

And that's just scratching the surface. If you're into org mode and ios, it's simply a must.
