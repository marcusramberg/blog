title: vim plugin for jekyll
---

Just added [this](https://github.com/csexton/jekyll.vim/) vim plugin to my
[vimrc](https://github.com/marcusramberg/dotfiles/blob/master/link/.vimrc), to make it easy to start a new post. If
you're interested, you could check out the rest of [my dotfiles](https://github.com/marcusramberg/dotfiles/) too, if
you have suggestions for  improvements, create an issue, or at [me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/marcusramberg/).
