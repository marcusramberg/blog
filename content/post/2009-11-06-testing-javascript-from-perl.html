title: Testing JavaScript from Perl
---
<p>If you want to write tests for your JavaScript code from Perl, Claes' module <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~claesjac/JavaScript-1.12/lib/Test/JavaScript/More.pm">Test::JavaScript::More</a> comes in handy. This module works by evaling everything from the use line as JavaScript. Of course, now you're mixing two languages in one file, which is not going to make any of your syntax validators happy. However, loading it like this will please both perl and jslint:</p>
<pre>
m| /* |; # Comment out JavaScript
use Test::JavaScript::More;
__END__ = '';  // It's is all JS from here. */
ok(1,'Success!');
</pre>
<p>One final note. I had some problems building the cpan module of JavaScript on OSX with Spidermonkey from ports. If you have the same problem, get the <a href="http://github.com/claesjac/javascript">latest and greatest version</a> from GitHub, which fixes this issue.</p>
