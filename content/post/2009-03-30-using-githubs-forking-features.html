title: Using github's forking features.
---
<p>A few week back, I commented some concerns about <a href="http://marcus.nordaaker.com/2009/03/git-results-in-silosgit-results-in-silos/">git causing silos</a>. I think this is a really good post by chris from github, illustrating the advantages of fully distributed development:</p>
<blockquote><p>It may seem strange, and perhaps even like a lot of work. “Why should I have to check to see which is the most current? In the old model, there’s always a canonical repository.”</p>
<p>In the old model, actionwebservice wouldn’t have made it past 1.2.6. Welcome to distributed version control.</p></blockquote>
