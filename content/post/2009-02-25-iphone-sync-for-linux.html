title: iPhone sync for linux
---
<p>With the newer iPhone/iPod firmware, Apple has been doing their best to lock out the Linux people and other 3. parties that want to modify the iPhone database. Of course, these crafty hackers did not take it lying down, but have figured out a way around this. Come on Apple, you already know DRM doesn't work, don't you? I figured that was why you want out of it on the iTunes store. Why bother continuing the fight on the devices? You'll only be humiliated again and again. These people have sufficient motivation to find a way around your obfuscation schemes.
