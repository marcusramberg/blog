title: Moose slides from Frozen Perl
---
<p>The Frozen Perl conference is going on in Minneapolis this weekend. For those of us who missed it, I think these slides by <a href="http://sartak.org/">Shawn M. Moore</a> are worth checking out. A good introduction to Moose, and the best Method Modifier examples I've seen.</p>
