I used 1 kg of ground beef for 4 burgers, and seasoned with salt, pepper, paprika powder, two ts of bbq sauce, a
squirt of mint chilli sauce.

To make the burgers, I use a [stuffed burger press](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000689186890.html), and make a
cup for the filling.

To make the filling, take a box of cream cheese and whip it a bit to loosen. Dice an avocado, slice some basil leaves,
and mix it in. Then use a spoon to fill the burger, finally put a lid of meat on top, and seal by squeezing gently on
the press. use a knife to loose from the press after evicting, and bbq until scrumptious. Add a slice of blue cheese
after flipping :)
