title: Tweeting from irssi with twirc
---

<p>
  When I started out with twitter, I used the native OSX client
  <a href="http://osx.iusethis.com/app/twitterrific">Twitterrific</a>. It's a
  pretty nice piece of software, but I couldn't get comfortable with it popping
  up every time there was a new tweet, as it was a bit too disturbing, and if I
  turned it off, I forgot to check it out at all.
</p>
<p>
  However, lately, I have a much better solution. I already communicate fairly
  frequently through the venerable Internet Relay Chat protocol (or IRC as most
  people know it). Thanks to <a href="http://github.com/semifor">semifor</a>, I
  now have Twitter as just another channel in my irssi screen:
</p>

<p>
  It runs as a separate process on my irc shell, pretending to be a IRC server.
  You can run it as a in the background, but for now I'm pretty happy with
  having it running as a new window in my screen session. Yes, I know that this
  setup marks me as a unrecoverable geek, but I don't care. It's just so sweet
  :-) If you don't have root privileges on your shell, you might find
  <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~apeiron/local-lib-1.003001/lib/local/lib.pm"
    >local::lib</a

  useful to install the required dependencies.
