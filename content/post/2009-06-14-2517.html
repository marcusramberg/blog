<p>Allan Odgaard reassures us that TextMate 2 isn't going to be a Duke Nukem Forever:</p>
<blockquote><p>So where does development stand for 2.0? It feels to me like most of the modules are getting close, say 90%. But as they say, on the horizon, mountains look small.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess he just has the remaining 90% to finish. :) I for one think this is exciting news. TextMate is probably my second most used program after Firefox.</p>
