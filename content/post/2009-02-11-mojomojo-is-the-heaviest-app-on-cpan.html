title: MojoMojo is the heaviest app on CPAN :)
---
<p>Adam Kennedy has released the Heaviest modules on CPAN list, showing that <a href="http://mojomojo.org/">MojoMojo</a> is currently the application with the biggest dependency graph on CPAN. This proves that we are firm opponents of the "Not Invented Here"-syndrome. :) I've volunteered <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~lbr/">lbr</a> to do the FreeBSD packages, anyone interested in packaging it for debian?  Feel free to <a href="mailto:marcus@nordaaker.com">contact me</a>.</p>
