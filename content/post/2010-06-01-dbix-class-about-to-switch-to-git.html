title: DBIx-Class about to switch to git

<blockquote>
<p>12:27 &lt;ribasushi&gt; a call to all git-heads</p>
<p>12:28 &lt;ribasushi&gt; recently haarg did a seemingly perfect conversion of dbic from svn to git (a non-trivial feat)</p>
<p>12:28 &lt;ribasushi&gt; I am calling for people who actually know git to randomly poke at the new history and notufy me of whatever problems they see</p>
<p>12:28 &lt;ribasushi&gt; <a href="http://github.com/haarg/DBIx-Class">http://github.com/haarg/DBIx-Class</a></p>
<p>12:29 &lt;ribasushi&gt; (also you can ascertain the quality of the conversion, and potentially draft haarg to do a catalyst conversion as well - it took him a couple of freaking hours to do dbic)</p>
<p>12:32 &lt;marcus&gt; awesome</p>
<p>12:32 &lt;marcus&gt; haarg++</p>
<p>12:33 &lt;marcus&gt; it looks freaking good</p>
<p>12:33 &lt;ribasushi&gt; marcus: please spread the word to get more eyeballs on this, if nothing pops up in the next day and a half we'll be  switching dbic over</p>

<p>﻿Consider this me having spread the word to you ;-)﻿</p>
