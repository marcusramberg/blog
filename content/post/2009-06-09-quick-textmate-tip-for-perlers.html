title: Quick textmate tip for Perlers
---

<p>
  Using Textmate for Perl programming? As you probably know, the Perl bundle
  supports validating your perl syntax with a quick shortcut. However, I picked
  up a quick tip from the "Javascript Tools" bundle. If you rebind the command
  as âŒ˜-S, TextMate will automatically check your syntax every time you save a
  Perl file. In case you need help doing this:
</p>
<p>In the menu Go to Bundles -> Bundle Editor -> Show Bundle Editor</p>
<p>
  Open the Perl Bundle, Click 'Validate syntax', and from there you can easily
  rebind the key as shown below.
