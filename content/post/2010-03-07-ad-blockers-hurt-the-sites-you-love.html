title: Ad blockers hurt the sites you love

<p>Good point from Ars Technica on ad blockers. This is defintively a problem we have with <a href="http://iusethis.com/">iusethis.com</a> as well, reducing the total number of ad views reduces our revenue.  I much prefer people to use a normal flash blocker. I can understand not wanting cpu consuming ads running in every tab of your browser.</p>
