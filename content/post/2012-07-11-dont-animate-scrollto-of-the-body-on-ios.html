title: Don't animate scrollTo of the body on iOS.
---
<p>Animate body.offsetTop and body.offsetLeft works great on the desktop, but Â is hugely buggy on MobileSafari. Instead, make a viewport div that fills the screen, and animate the offset on that.</p>
<p>I hope this helps someone, as I spent 3 hours figuring it out.</p>
