<pre>
< @ask_> Looks like DirectI/resellerclub (the domain registrar) decided 
to  suspend perl.org!  I've no idea why.  They're not a communicative 
bunch.  Also, nice touch doing it on a Saturday.</pre

  For now, if you need access to search.cpan.org, you can reach it directly by
  ip: <a href=" http://207.115.101.144/"> http://207.115.101.144/</a> Also, note
  that you can access the catalyst framework home page through
  <a href="http://www.catalystframework.org/"
    >http://www.catalystframework.org/</a
  >. You can read more about it from
  <a

    >Ask's blog</a

  *update* perl.org is back, serenity has been restored to the world. Hopefully
  they will also move to a less insane provider soon.
