title: Onion browser - TOR on IOS
---

<p>
  The Onion Router is a internet project that aims to anonymize your traffic by
  routing it through a dark-net with various exit points to the Internet.
  Normally you would have to install a browser proxy on your machine to access
  TOR, but now there's a
  <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/onion-browser/id519296448?mt=8"
    >browser available for the iPad and iPhone</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, I had to test it by checking out the
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)">Silk Road</a>,
  a much publicized "Amazon of illegal drugs" that only exists on the TOR
  network.
