In just a couple of weeks, we are arranging a new conference in Oslo - [mojoconf](http://mojoconf.org/) - A conference
dedicated to the Mojolicious Web Framework, the real time web and Perl. It is a three day affair, with commercial
training on friday, talks on saturday, and a hackathon on sunday.

Attending the conference and the hackathon is just 20EUR, and Oslo in the spring time is not bad either, so obey the
Hypnotoad and come to Oslo the weekend 23-25 may!
