In just a couple of weeks, we are arranging a new conference in Oslo - [Mojoconf](http://mojoconf.org/) - A conference dedicated to the Mojolicious Web Framework, the real time web and Perl. It is a three day affair, with commercial training on friday, talks on saturday, and a hackthon on sunday.

Attending the conference and the hackathon is just 20EUR, and Oslo in the spring time is not bad either, so obey the Hypnotoad and come to Oslo the weekend 23-25 may!
