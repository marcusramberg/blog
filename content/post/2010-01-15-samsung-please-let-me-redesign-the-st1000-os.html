title: Samsung, please let me redesign the ST1000 OS
---
<p><i>I just bought a new compact camera, a Samsung ST1000 (or CL65 in the US). It's a lovely piece of hardware, a 12 mpixel camera with a 28-135 lens and image stabilization, GPS, Wifi all in a small sleek package. However, it has some issues. Here's my reaction as captured on IRC after trying to use the internet sharing features:</i></p>

21:13 < @marcus> my camera's firmware was written by idiots.
21:14 < @marcus> samsung--
21:14 < @marcus> it "supports" picasa and youtube and facebook
21:14 < @marcus> but can only upload 320x200 videos of less than 30 seconds                      
                to youtube
21:14 < @marcus> and only pics to facebook

21:15 < @marcus> it's a 12mpixel camera tho
21:15 < @marcus> with 5x optic zoom

21:15 < @marcus> and a decent flash
21:15 < @marcus> and 720p video
21:16 < @marcus> if the software wasn't so horrible, it'd be awesome
21:16 < @marcus> 3.5" touch screen
21:17 < @marcus> it's got a gps and wifi
21:17 < @marcus> WTF
