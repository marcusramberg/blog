title: We Are Iron Man
---

<p>
  Went to visit the Oslo rubyists today just to get the old worn out 'But we
  heard perl is dead', as a welcome. So worn out. Somehow they acknowledge that
  python is a nice language tho. So why has nobody heard from us in a while?
  Matt has a theory.

    But here's my point: Perl people hang out on mailing lists. We bottom post,
    carefully interleaved, with 76 character lines. We have signatures that meet
    the McQ standard for acceptable size. We hang out on IRC servers and bitch,
    moan, interact and collaborate with the aid of an 80x25 xterm with irssi,
    BitchX or IrcII in it[3]. Sometimes we sit at home with a beer and do one or
    more of the above. Forums? Meh. Those are the things the PHPtards like
    because they can't figure out how to work a mailing list, right? Blogs?
    That's not even a fucking word! I mean, in my day, we posted to usenet using
    Larry Wall's rn that didn't even have decent fucking threading, and we
    schlepped the posts about from one bnews spool to another over 1200 baud
    dial-up links, and we liked it!

  Obviously, those pesky kids never read our mailing lists ;) Luckily, Matt also
  has a plan. Join up to the
  <em>Enlightened Perl: Blogging Iron Man</em> competition now and show what you
  are made of! We can do it, yes we can :) And if we are really good, we'll get
  to see Matt talk about why he loves bunnies with his hair dyed baby pink! Even
  if you're not gonna blog, it's worth reading for the sheer awesomeness of his
  rant :)
