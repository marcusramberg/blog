  So, it seems that people are actually reading my ramblings. For instance,
  <a href="http://lumberjaph.net/blog/">Franck Cuny</a> read my description of
  the
  <a
    href="http://marcus.nordaaker.com/2009/05/awesome-route-graph-with-mojoxroutesasgraph/"
    >Mojo routes graph generator</a
  >. Then he took it upon himself to write the
  <a
    href="http://github.com/franckcuny/CatalystX--Dispatcher--AsGraph/tree/master"
    >Catalyst equivalent</a
  >. That is just so awesome!

  Frank says "For the moment only private actions are graphed.", hopefully, it
  can be extended to understand chained actions. I can't wait to test it out on
  the <a href="http://iusethis.com/">iusethis</a> code base. Now I can just hand
  this graph to <a href="http://arne.nordaaker.com/">Arne</a> when he wants to
  know which template matches which action.
