title: Automatic deployment with Catalyst and Git
---
<p>Mike Nachbaur has written a description of how he deploys his Catalyst-based site to  production  using git and catalyst, while autoupdating dependencies and ensuring that his tests har run successfully. We currently deploy <a href="http://iusethis.com/">iusethis</a> in a similar fashion, although a little bit more manually, and with a staging server to test larger rollouts.</p>
