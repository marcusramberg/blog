title: Last Ninja on the WII
---
<p>Nintendo has started offering C64 titles on the WII, and one of the launch titles are one of my all time favorite games, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Ninja">The Last Ninja</a>. I just spent way too much time getting through that swamp. If you don't know what it's all about, you can check out this long play video.</p>

<p>Another launch title is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Karate">International Karate</a>, which was arguably my first exposure to Versus Fighting Games, a category that have consumed more of my time than any others, with game series like Street Fighter and Tekken. I did buy Street Fighter IV when it was released on friday, but it hasn't been able to wrestle my attention away from Tekken V Online. </p>
