<p>As you might know, Sebastian recently <a href="http://labs.kraih.com/blog/2009/07/perl-is-awesome.html">added single-file support to his Mojolicious framework</a>. Viacheslav Tikhanovskii has taken this functionality and run with it, producing bootylicious - a ~280 SLOC web log system. It sorts a directory of POD formatted blog posts, and even supports RSS. I think these single file apps is an excellent way to demonstrate your framework. I actually remember this as being a selling point for Maypole back in the days :)</p>
