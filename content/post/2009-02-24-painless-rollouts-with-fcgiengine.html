title: Painless roll-outs with FCGI::Engine
---

<p>
  Our software site <a href="http://iusethis.com/">i use this</a> is built on
  the MVC Framework <a href="http://catalyst.perl.org/">Catalyst</a>. We
  currently run it using the Russian web server
  <a href="http://wiki.codemongers.com/Main">Nginx</a> and standalone fastcgi
  servers. I am using the Moose based
  <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~stevan/FCGI-Engine-0.06/">CGI::Engine</a>
  distribution by Stevan Little to start the servers. This module makes it
  really easy to manage your applications. You just create a YML config file
  like this:
</p>
<pre>
---
- name: "iusethis-osx.server"
  nproc: 4
  scriptname: "/www/iusethis-osx/script/iusethis_fastcgi.pl"
  pidfile: "/var/run/iusethis-osx.pid"
  socket: "/var/run/iusethis-osx.sock" 
</pre>
<p>
  with an entry for each server you want to run. (Note that the paths has been
  changed to protect the innocent.) Then you just create a simple perl script
  (See the
  <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/~stevan/FCGI-Engine-0.06/lib/FCGI/Engine/Manager.pm"
    >FCGI::Engine::Manager SYNOPSIS</a
  >
  for a sample), and you can easily start, stop and check the status for each
  application individually or every application in your config. If you have a
  system v style init, you can just stick the script in /etc/init.d/ and it will
  behave just like any of your other startup scripts.
</p>
<p>
  There is one annoying detail. Each time you roll out code, you have to restart
  your fastcgi processes. Since Catalyst takes some time to initialize, the
  application is down, and end users gets 500 Internal Server Error responses,
  unless you have a load balancer in front and take the node out of the cluster
  before upgrading. It does not have to work like this. Since the fcgi workers
  use a non-exclusive lock on the socket, you can start a new set of processes
  before you kill the old ones. this way, no requests are lost.
</p>
<p>
  I really wanted this feature, so I have spent some time today hacking on
  FCGI::Engine. Stevan accepted my patches, and released version
  <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~stevan/FCGI-Engine-0.06/">0.06</a>, which
  supports this restart mode, via a new 'graceful' method added to
  FCGI::Engine::Manager + some bug fixes. Nginx already support
  <a href="http://wiki.codemongers.com/NginxCommandLine#utnbotf"
    >On the fly upgrades</a
  >, which means there is no need for us to drop a user connection when rolling
  out new code again.
