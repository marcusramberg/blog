title: Tab bar or no Tab bar?
---

<p>
  Interesting writeup from Justin Williams about the use of Tab Bars in iPhone
  development. One of his big gripes is related to the space the tab-bar uses:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    When I made the decision, my thinking was that the application had four
    separate features, so it only made sense to separate them using the tab bar.
    What I found as I got further into the development of the application was
    that the bottom tab bar was incredibly limiting for where to place extra
    controls.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  The main problem here is that by default a Tab Bar is visible in all views of
  the application. I much prefer
  <a href="http://iphone.iusethis.com/app/tweetie">Tweetie</a>'s implementation,
  where the tab bar is only visible on list views, and pushed away on the detail
  views. Of course, this layout is actively discouraged by Apple, who recommend
  you put your navigation controller *inside* each tab bar. They do it the
  opposite way themselves in itunes tho.
</p>
<p>
  Also, the interaction allowed by the Tab bar is really limited. You cannot
  easily disable and enable a tab, for instance. Still, I believe this way of
  presenting data has merit, specially in giving non-technical users a clear
  overview of the main parts of your application.
</p>

  <em>*update*</em> As Ross Boucher
  <a href="http://twitter.com/boucher/status/2552630433">points out</a> you can
  also hide the Tab Bar by setting the "hidesBottomBarWhenPushed" property on
  your controllers. An important gotcha with this is to make sure you only set
  it on the first level controllers.
