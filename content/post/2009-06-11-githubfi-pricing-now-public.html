  GitHub created a headache for themselves at the initial launch of their
  in-house hosting option for companies wanting to use GitHub.

    That, coupled with the fact that we wanted companies to sign an NDA before
    receiving their quote, slowed the entire process down. It also bewildered
    more than a few people wondering why lawyers needed to be involved just to
    figure out how much the product cost.

  Well, now they are up for everybody to see, but boy, with prices like that, I
  can see why they would like to keep them secret. $600/user/year. First year up
  front. For us, having 5 accounts, which is what we get with their 'Small'
  plan, it would be an upgrade from 144 USD to 7200 USD per year. After the
  first year we'd have to add 750$ a year if we want standard support. I doubt
  this is a very viable plan for most development shops. Specially considering
  <a href="http://gitorious.org/">Gitorious</a> is open source.
