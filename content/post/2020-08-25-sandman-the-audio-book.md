Just finished this, and it was glorious. Great voice acting, and I could almost see the comic strips from so long ago
in my mind while reading. Wether you have good memories of the graphics novel, or you have ignored it because "comics
aren't real books", I warmly recommended checking out this epic version of the story of the endless.
