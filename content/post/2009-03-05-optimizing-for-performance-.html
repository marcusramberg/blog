<p>Thanks to <a href="http://daringfireball.net">mr. Gruber</a> for linking to this really interesting acticle about performance policies in the WebKit project:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have a zero-tolerance policy for performance regressions. If a patch lands that regresses performance according to our benchmarks, then the person responsible must either back the patch out of the tree or drop everything immediately and fix the regression.</p></blockquote>
<p>As we've been working towards Catalyst 5.8, I think this is a test we need to get in place to ensure that 5.8 can handle the same volume of request processing as the previous version.</p>
