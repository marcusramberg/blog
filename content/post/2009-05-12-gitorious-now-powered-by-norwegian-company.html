title: Gitorious now powered by norwegian company
---
<p>Even though we're currently using <a href="http://github.com/">github</a> for all our git hosting needs, we do like the open source alternative <a href="http://gitorious.org">gitorious</a>. It makes us happy that it's now officially supported by some of our favorite rubyists from Oslo.</p>
<blockquote><p>Gitorious now is a project maintained by Shortcut AS, which I co-founded. Shortcut AS now officially supports and develops Gitorious in cooperation with contributors outside Shortcut. Gitorious is, and will continue to be, 100% free software, licensed under the Affero GPL.</p></blockquote>
<p>With my open source hat on, I am looking forward getting <a href="http://catalyst.perl.org/">Catalyst</a> moved over to Git in the near future.  Hopefully we can get a nice gitorious setup for both Moose and Catalyst. </p>
