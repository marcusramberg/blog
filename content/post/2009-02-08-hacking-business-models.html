title: Hacking business models
---
<p>Zak Greant, the original Mysql hacker has done some serious thinking about business models for small hacker companies. This is definitively something that Nordaaker needs to deal with, if we are to grow beyond our current small numbers. I really like these thoughts compared to the thinking I've met in most traditional companies. They seem more suited to modern technology workers.</p>
