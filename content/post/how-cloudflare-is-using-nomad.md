title: How Cloudflare is using Nomad
---

Hashicorp has made some of my favorite tools for cloud architecture, including Terraform, Consul and Vault. One
interesting component I've yet to try is Nomad; a lightweight alternative to Kubernetes for keeping your container
workload running.

Cool to see how Cloudflare is using it.
