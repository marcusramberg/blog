    First, and most important, can we do something to make the logo BIGGER and
    more prominent? I’ve done a quick sketch using the circumference of my
    coffee cup as a reference guide (see attached) and I’m sure we all agree
    that the new eagle is much easier to see at about three times the current
    size (I’m not sure what that is in computer picas). Everyone agrees that the
    new eagle logo my daughter drew is GORGEOUS, so I really want those feathers
    to stand out over the “Stool” info scrolling through the eagle’s mouth
    (beak? bill? not important).

<p>Great fun.</p>
